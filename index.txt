This is the RedEvents API.

Currently you can make the following queries by appending to the url:

/events - Get all of the events that Cornell currently lists

/events/:endTime - Get events from now up to (endTime) (not including endTime).  Useful when you don't really want
every event for the next five months.  endTime should be a UNIX timestamp.

/events/:beginTime/:endTime - Get events in the range [beginTime,endTime).

/contacts - Get a list of emergency contact information (last updated December 2015)

/libraries - Get today's hours for all of Cornell's libraries

/maps/bikeracks - bikerack locations

/maps/bluelight - bluelight locations

/maps/buildings - building locations

/maps/stops - tcat stop locations


While we try our best to make this data accurate, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of any of the data
for any purpose.  See the license on github.

Map data comes from the Cornell Open Data Initiative.  See https://github.com/cornell-data
