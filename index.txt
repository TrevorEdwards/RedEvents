This is the RedEvents API.

Currently you can make the following queries by appending to the url:

/events - Get all of the events that Cornell currently lists

/events/:endTime - Get events from now up to (endTime) (not including endTime).  Useful when you don't really want
every event for the next five months.  endTime should be a UNIX timestamp.

/events/:beginTime/:endTime - Get events in the range [beginTime,endTime).

/contacts - Get a list of emergency contact information (last updated December 2015)

/libraries - Get today's hours for all of Cornell's libraries
