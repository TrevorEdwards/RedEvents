This is the RedEvents API.

Currently you can make the following queries by appending to the url:

/events - Get all of the events that Cornell currently lists

/events/:endTime - Get events up to [endTime].  Useful when you don't really want
every event for the next five months.  endTime should be a UNIX timestamp.
