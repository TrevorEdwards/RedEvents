# RedEvents

RedEvents is a NodeJS API for those who wish to develop informational services (apps, etc) for Cornell students.

See it running [here](https://redevents.herokuapp.com/).

# Structure
The app is set up as a standard express app with a mongoose wrapper over mongo.

All data scraping/routes are within the routes folder. New functionality can be put into its own file. For example,
library data scraping and routes are within routes/libraries.js.
